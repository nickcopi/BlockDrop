Click on the blocks before they hit the ground. Clicking on blocks shrinks the game field size. If a block slips by when the field is at max size, you lose.

This game was rushed together in the last few hours of the event and I made an Apache Cordova mobile build. The behavior is a bit odd sometimes but overall it is pretty good for how simple it is.
